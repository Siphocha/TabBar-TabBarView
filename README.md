# TabBar-TabBarView

HOW TO RUN APPLICATION:
1. Go into directory of applications "tabdisplay"
2. pick an emulator form your list of emulators (should have some).
3. Get the emulator up and running (cold boot btw)
4. Then go to terminal and put "flutter run"

Attribute Notes:
For clarification. TabBar and it's subsequent TabBarView are Layoutwidgets. As such,
their attributes are in the realm of aesthetics and not necessarily logical progression of the app but to add to the apps feel.

Examples of which are:

indicatorColor: Useful for colour under tab indicator

indicatorWeight: Useful for putting "thickness" on indicator colour

tabs: Literally exactly for representing individual tabs.
